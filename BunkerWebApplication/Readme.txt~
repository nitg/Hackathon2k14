Since we have 80% cutoff attendance we need to closely track our bunks,and make decision statistically rather than emotionally. The simplest and the most efficient way to do it estimate the total no of classes, log bunks so far, and subtract Total possible Bunk with classes bunked so far. Implement it in web application that could be implemented on Google App Engine. Best of Luck!
