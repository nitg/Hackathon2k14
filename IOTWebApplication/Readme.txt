Home automation requires all peripheral to be connected. For this project we will be coming up with an application which can use webiopi framework to build application that could be deployed over app engine.

This project is challenging since it cointains a lots of disjoint component.
1)App Engine Implementation
2)Design Of webpage
3)WebIoPi Interface with pi

Best of Luck!
